## Description

MongoDB is my preferred choice for many social networks due to its scalability and flexibility in handling large amounts of unstructured data. In this project, I've built a robust API for a social network web application using Express.js and MongoDB with Mongoose ODM.This API enables users to share their thoughts, react to others' posts, and manage their friend lists seamlessly. It features endpoints for users, thoughts, reactions, and friends, allowing for CRUD operations on each resource.

With validation, virtuals, and subdocuments implemented, the API ensures data integrity and efficient handling of user interactions. The acceptance criteria have been met, enabling me to start the server, perform CRUD operations using Insomnia, and experience a smooth social networking experience.

Explore the defined models and API routes to understand the functionality of this social network API and how it empowers developers like me to create engaging social applications with ease.
